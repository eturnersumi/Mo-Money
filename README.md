User Story
As a person that loves to travel but doesn't love to keep up with the money I spend, I need a way to track withdrawals and deposits both while I'm on my mobile network and off of my mobile network, so that I can practice money management and discipline. 


Business Context
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
